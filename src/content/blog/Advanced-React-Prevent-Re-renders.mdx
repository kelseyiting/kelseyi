I came across this book [Advanced React by Nadia Makarevich](https://www.advanced-react.com/) one day and decided to give it a try. It turns out to be such a wonderful read! This book is informative and contains lots of code examples to help wrap your head around complex ideas. I decided to write down some reading notes for future references.

The book introduces some ways to prevent re-renders and how easily memoization can be messed up using React.memo.

## How to prevent unnecessary re-renders

1. Move States Down

   Say your boss wants to add a modal and a toggler on a page with some very slow components. Intuitively, one may code out something like this:

   ```jsx
   const Component = () => {
   	const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
   	return (
   		<div>
   			<VerySlowComponent />
   			{isOpen && <Modal />}
   			<Button onClick={setIsOpen(true)}>Open Modal</Button>
   		<div>
   	)
   }
   ```

   This achieves what the boss needs, but performance wise the state is causing Component to re-render, and also re-render all its children recursively. Before you put a bunch of memo, useMemo, and useCallback, you may check if performance can be improved by composition.

   ```jsx
   const ModalWithButton = () => {
   	const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)
   	return (
   		<>
   			{isOpen && <Modal />}
   			<Button onClick={setIsOpen(true)}>Open Modal</Button>
   		<>
   	)
   }

   const Component = () => {
   	return (
   		<div>
   			<VerySlowComponent />
   			<ModalWithButton />
   		<div>
   	)
   }
   ```

   Once you move modal-related states down to its own component, the unnecessary re-renders of Component caused by modal state changes are gone.

2. Elements as Props

   Next day, your boss wants to listen for scroll event of a page that has very slow components.

   ```jsx
   const Component = () => {
   	const [scroll, setScroll] = useState(0)
   	return (
   		<div onScroll={({currentTarget})=>{setScroll(currentTarget.scrollTop)}}>
   			<VerySlowComponent />
   			<ALotOfVerySlowComponent />
   		<div>
   	)
   }
   ```

   Again, adding it this way is very straightforward but can cause performance problem. Every time a user scrolls through the page, Component updates the scroll state which triggers re-renders to Component and all its children. This can also be tackled with composition.

   ```jsx
   const ContainerWithScroll = ({children}) => {
   	const [scroll, setScroll] = useState(0)
   	return (
   		<div onScroll={({currentTarget})=>{setScroll(currentTarget.scrollTop)}}>
   			{children}
   		<div>
   	)
   }

   const Component = () => {
   	return (
   		<ContainerWithScroll>
   			<VerySlowComponent />
   			<ALotOfVerySlowComponent />
   		</ContainerWithScroll>
   	)
   }
   ```

   Because VerySlowComponent and ALotOfVerySlowComponent are created outside of ContainerWithScroll and passed in as props, whenever ContainerWithScroll re-renders due to scroll state updates, the children reference remains unchanged, thus React will not re-render those components. The same technique applies to any props, not just children.

3. Memoization

   If none of the above composition methods are viable, memoization comes in handy.

   There are two major use cases:

   1. Props are dependencies to hooks in downstream components

   If props from parent are dependencies in children hooks, each time Parent re-renders causes children to re-render and thus re-run all hooks in children.

   ```jsx
   const Parent = () => {
   	const onMount = useCallback(()=>{}, [])
   	return <Child onMount={onMount} />
   }

   const Child = ({onMount}) => {
   	useEffect(()=>{
   		onMount()
   	},[onMount])
   	// The onMount function reference stays the same during parent re-renders, so useEffect won't be re-run.
   	return ...
   }
   ```

   2. A component is wrapped in React.memo

   To make sure children skip re-renders when their props are unchanged, wrap the children component in React.memo, and make sure all non-primitives/non-constant props are memoized via useCallback and useMemo.

   ```jsx
   const MemoChild = memo(Child)

   const Parent = () => {
   	const onMount = useCallback(() => {}, [])
   	// ✅ MemoChild won't re-render unless onMount function reference changes.
   	return <MemoChild onMount={onMount} />
   }
   ```

   However, there are some caveats when using React.memo. often times developers may overlook details and causes React.memo to not work as expected.

   ```jsx
   const MemoChild = memo(Child)
   const Parent = () => {
   	// ⛔ data prop is created anew everytime Parent re-renders! memo is now useless.
   	return <MemoChild data={{ age: 10 }} />
   }
   ```

   ```jsx
   const MemoChild = memo(Child)
   const Parent = () => {
   	const { submit } = useForm()
   	// ⛔ When submit is not a memoized function, memo is useless again!
   	return <MemoChild onSubmit={submit} />
   }
   ```

   ```jsx
   const MemoChild = memo(Child)
   const Parent = () => {
   	// ⛔ children is a prop too, written this way children get re-created every re-render. Memo is agian, useless!
   	return <MemoChild>
   		<div>Lovely grandchild!</div>
   	</MemoChild>
   ```

   ```jsx
   const MemoChild = memo(Child)
   const MemoParent = memo(Parent)

   const Wrapper = () => {
   	// ⛔ MemoParent's children props contain MemoChild, which gets re-created every Wrapper re-renders.
   	return <MemoParent>
   		<MemoChild />
   	</MemoParent>
   ```

   To fix problems related to children, we need to make sure we memoize children element references, not just children component functions.

   ```jsx
   const MemoChild = memo(Child)
   const MemoParent = memo(Parent)

   const Wrapper = () => {
   	const child = useMemo(() => <MemoChild />, [])
   	return <MemoParent>{child}</MemoParent>
   }
   ```
